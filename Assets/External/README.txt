In order to build the game, you will need a few assets first. Check the GitHub's README on how to obtain these assets. Once you have them, create a folder called Blacklist in this External folder and place the assets inside. 

If you do not wish to obtain these assets, you can modify your version to work without them (just work through the errors)

We are working with the asset developers to try and come up with a plan so we can include the required parts of each asset to avoid this process in the future!
