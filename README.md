# Note about this repository
Since Vectorio contains paid cosmetics and a DLC mode, some of the assets used in those systems are not present in this repository. Because of that, I cannot provide a license to the repository. This also means that if you try to build the game, you will have to heavily modify the source to get it to work. 

Keeping these things in mind, it's better to treat the repository as something you can reference for your own projects, rather than one you can make contributions to.
