# Core Refactor 
Though the current setup of the game works fine, it does not support extensive modding or multiplayer. It is both outdated and inefficient, so over the course of v0.2 multiple changes will be made to the base code to improve on these things as well as help streamline the development process. 

**What does the refactor include?**
